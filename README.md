# :milky_way: Mirage-UI

Mirage-UI is a set of easily accessible, reusable, and composable design components and animations that make it super easy to improve the user experience of your websites and applications.

## :octocat: Introduction -

-   Mirage-UI is the next stop for all your design and animation needs.
-   We promote the community to contribute their designs and take designs from the repository for their community or personal projects.
-   Our moto `No Contribution is small` and we appreciate each and every contribution from all of you.

## :scroll: Instructions to follow while contributing -

-   Make sure that with every design/ component should be added to a separate folder.
-   Every folder should have its own `README.md` file where instructions to setup environment should be there and a demo video in the form of a gif should be added. You can host it on any website and insert the link in the README.md file to save space in the repository.
    -   Prefered hosting sites are:
        -   [Imgur](https://imgur.com/)
        -   [Gifyu](https://gifyu.com/?lang=en)
        -   [Giphy](https://giphy.com/)
        -   [Tenor](https://tenor.com/)
-   Refer to the [README Template](README_TEMPLATE.md) to make the README for the component you add.
-   Always update the table of contents in the parent folder where the new component is added.
-   Whether you are adding an animation or a design component or any other code, **make sure to include all the additional scripts and CDN's within the file/ folder itself and the code must be extremely simple to understand such that it is immediately ready for use in some project.**
-   Make sure to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ALPHAVIO/WordNook/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and be respectful towards everyone while contributing to the project.
